> Leash up. It is critical that new adopters keep their dogs on a leash at all times during transport.

---

第一天在外面時，務必隨時要上牽繩！！



> the sooner they get the dog home, the sooner they can all settle into their new lives – and providing calm and routine will make that happen a lot quicker.

---

趕快回家，讓狗狗快點建立安全感以及熟悉環境，不要第一天就帶著狗出去玩。



> Tell adopters that once they’re home they should remain outside with the dog on leash until she urinates, and ideally until she defecates as well. From day one the dog will start to learn where the adopter expects her to relieve herself.

---

進家門前，先確保狗狗上完廁所（大小便），避免回到家不小心解放，學到不對的習慣。



> The resident dog’s routine should be kept as familiar as possible. Let adopters know that handled properly, the relationship between the resident dog and the new pet will blossom over time.

---

原先的狗狗一定要特別關注牠的需求！不要讓新來的狗狗打壞他原本的行程和習慣，或強迫彼此認識。交朋友的事讓他們自己來。
