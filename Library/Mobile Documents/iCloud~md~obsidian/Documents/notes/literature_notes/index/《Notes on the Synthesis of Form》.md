we cannot hope to understand this highly "interlaced" and complex phenomenon #flashcard/vocabulary 
To cross one another as if woven together

---

We want to put the context and the form into effortless contact or frictionless "coexistence". #flashcard/vocabulary 
the state or fact of living or existing at the same time or in the same place.

---

Yet it is such "departures from" the norm which stand out in our minds, rather than the norm itself. #flashcard/vocabulary 
a deviation from an accepted, prescribed, or traditional course of action or thought.

---

Suppose we are given a button to match, from among a box of "assorted" buttons. How do we proceed? #flashcard/vocabulary 
of various sorts/types put together

---

We scan the buttons, rejecting each one in which we notice some "discrepancy" #flashcard/vocabulary 
a difference between two things that should be the same.

---

Equality is the "intrinsic" value of democracy. Without equality there can be no democracy. #flashcard/vocabulary 
belonging naturally; essential

---

We take just those relations between form and context which "obtrude" most strongly, which demand attention most clearly, which seem most likely to go wrong. #flashcard/vocabulary 
become noticeable in an unwelcome or intrusive way

---

we were "in possession of" a field description of the context #flashcard/phrases_idioms 
the fact that you have or own something.

---

a state of "affairs" that is not either in the form alone or in the context alone, but a relation between the two. #flashcard/vocabulary 
happening, event

---
In the unselfconscious culture the same form is made over and over again ; in order to learn form-making, people need only learn to repeat a single familiar physical pattern. In the self conscious culture new purposes are occurring all the time ; the people who make forms are constantly required to deal with problems that are either entirely new or at best modifications of old problems. Under these circumstances it is not enough to copy old physical patterns. — location: [422]() ^ref-46116

we can very easily deduce the inner nature of the system, — location: [518]() ^ref-23788

---
The reaction of the system to the disturbance is the reaction of the form-making process to the misfit. — location: [523]() ^ref-9740

---
cultural deflection — location: [530]() ^ref-64688

---
If, on the other hand, a form-making process is such that a minor culture change can upset the good fit of the forms it produces, then any well-fitting forms we may observe at one time or another fit only by accident ; and the next cultural deflection may once more lead to the production of badly fitting forms. — location: [528]() ^ref-46392

---
the formbuilders in unselfconscious cultures respond to small changes in a way that allows the subsystems of the misfit system to work independently - but that because the selfconscious response to change cannot take place subsystem by subsystem, its forms are arbitrary. — location: [531]() ^ref-65374

he does not do so by remembering the general rule and then applying it ("When the snow starts to melt it is too hot inside the igloo and therefore time to ... "). He simply does it. And though words may accompany his action, they play no essential part in it. This is the important point. The failure or inadequacy of the form leads directly to the action. — location: [579]() ^ref-62366

---
There is no deliberation in between the recognition of a failure and the reaction to it. — location: [582]() ^ref-59195

---
The process must be able to achieve its equilibrium before the next culture change upsets it again . It must actually have time to reach its equilibrium every time it is disturbed- or, if we see the process as continuous rather than intermittent, the adjustment of forms must proceed more quickly than the drift of the culture context. — location: [592]() ^ref-51466

---
the speed of adaptation depends essentially on whether the adaptation can take place in independent and restricted subsystems, or not. — location: [595]() ^ref-46403

This viscosity damps the changes made, and prevents their extension to other aspects of the form . As a result only urgent changes are allowed — location: [604]() ^ref-35970

---
repercussions — location: [605]() ^ref-60570

---
the directness of the response to misfit ensures that each failure is corrected as soon as it occurs, and thereby restricts the change to one subsystem at a time. — location: [606]() ^ref-10688

---
contradictory. — location: [609]() ^ref-440

---
it is able to adjust subsystem by subsystem, so that the process of adjustment is faster than the rate at which the culture changes; equilibrium is certain to be re-established whenever slight disturbances occur ; and the forms are not simply well-fitted to their cultures, but in active equilibrium with them. — location: [611]() ^ref-21764

---
The man who makes the form is an agent simply, and very little is required of him during the form's development. Even the most aimless changes will eventually lead to well-fitting forms, because of the tendency to equilibrium inherent in the organization of the process. — location: [614]() ^ref-3764

---
All the agent need do is to recognize failures when they occur, and to react to them. And this even the simplest man can do. — location: [616]() ^ref-26454

---

---
innate artistry, — location: [625]() ^ref-20051

---
clumsiness. — location: [626]() ^ref-56184

---
The shawlmakers were simply able, as many of us are, to recognize bad shawls, and their own mistakes. Over the generations the shawls had doubtless often been made extremely badly. But whenever a bad one was made, it was recognized as such, and therefore not repeated. — location: [627]() ^ref-50050

---
So we do not need to pretend that these craftsmen had special ability. They made beautiful shawls by standing in a long tradition, and by making minor changes whenever something seemed to need improvement. But once presented with more complicated choices, their apparent mastery and judgment disappeared. — location: [631]() ^ref-48627

---
Faced with the complex unfamiliar task of actually inventing forms from scratch, they were unsuccessful. — location: [633]() ^ref-29021

---
a property of — location: [636]() ^ref-30207

---
In one way it is easy enough to see what goes wrong with the arrival of selfconsciousness. The very features which we have found responsible for stability in the unselfconscious process begin to disappear. — location: [637]() ^ref-45248

---
The reaction to failure, once so direct , now becomes less and less direct. Materials are no longer close to hand. Buildings are more permanent, frequent repair and readjustment less common, than they used to be. — location: [639]() ^ref-44086

---
Construction is no longer in the hands of the inhabitants; failures, when they occur, have to be several times reported and described before the specialist will recognize them and make some permanent adjustment. — location: [640]() ^ref-35180

---
failures now need to be quite considerable before they will induce correction. — location: [642]() ^ref-56392

---
willful — location: [643]() ^ref-5890

---
allowed ample time for adaptation, — location: [648]() ^ref-36810

---
No sooner is adjustment of one kind begun than the culture takes a further turn and forces the adjustment in a new direction. No adjustment is ever finished. And the essential condition on the process- that it should in fact have time to reach its equilibrium - is violated. — location: [649]() ^ref-5465

---
selfconsciousness is found in Samoa. Although ordinary Samoan houses are built by their inhabitants-to-be, custom demands that guest houses be built exclusively by carpenters.2 Since these carpenters need to find clients, they are in business as artists; and they begin to make personal innovations and changes for no reason except that prospective clients will judge their work for its inventiveness. — location: [659]() ^ref-5689

---
The form-maker's assertion — location: [662]() ^ref-52973

---

---
The development of architectural individualism is the clearest manifestation of the moment when architecture first turns into a selfconscious discipline. — location: [664]() ^ref-27326

---
becomes ripe for serious thought and theory. — location: [667]() ^ref-17838

---
unformulated precepts of tradition — location: [669]() ^ref-62604

---
With the invention of a teachable discipline called "architecture, " the old process of making form was adulterated and its chances of success destroyed. — location: [673]() ^ref-6202

---
As we have seen, the system, being selfadjusting, finds its own equilibrium - provided only that misfit incites some reaction in the craftsman. The forms produced in such a system are not the work of individuals, and their success does not depend on any one man's artistry, but only on the artist's place within the process. — location: [677]() ^ref-13206

---
To achieve in a few hours at the drawing board what once took centuries of adaptation and development, to invent a form suddenly which clearly fits its context- the extent of the invention necessary is beyond the average designer. — location: [682]() ^ref-32799

---
the child who shakes his glass-topped puzzle fretfully — location: [684]() ^ref-33700

---
The designer's attempt is hardly random as the child's is ; but the difficulties are the same. His chances of success are small because the number of factors which must fall simultaneously into place is so enormous. — location: [685]() ^ref-22725

like that in the diagram on the next page. — location: [713]() ^ref-10489

---
To help himself overcome the difficulties of complexity, the designer tries to organize his problem. He classifies its various aspects, thereby gives it shape, and makes it easier to handle. What bothers him is not only the difficulty of the problem either. The constant burden of decision which he comes across, once freed from tradition, is a tiring one. — location: [718]() ^ref-58813

---
he avoids it where he can by using rules (or general principles), which he formulates in terms of his invented concepts. These principles are at the root of all so-called "theories" of architectural design.12 They are prescriptions which relieve the burden of selfconsciousness and of too much responsibility. — location: [721]() ^ref-23749

The moment the student is free to question what he is told, and value is put on explanation, it becomes important to decide why "this " is the right way rather than " that," and to look for general reasons. — location: [728]() ^ref-10413

the variables of such a system can be adjusted to meet the specified conditions in a reasonable time only if its subsystems are adjusted independently of one another. A subsystem, roughly speaking, is one of the obvious components of the system, like the parts shown with a circle round them. — location: [739]() ^ref-11214

---
repercussions — location: [742]() ^ref-60570

---
if he tries to manipulate them all at once he will not manage to find a well-fitting form in any reasonable time. When he himself senses this difficulty, he tries to break the problem down, and so invents concepts to help himself decide which subsets of requirements to deal with independently. Now what are these concepts, in terms of the system of variables? Each concept identifies a certain collection of the variables. " Economics " identifies one part of the system, " safety " another, " acoustics " another, and so on. — location: [745]() ^ref-9751

---
These concepts will not help the designer in finding a well-adapted solution unless they happen to correspond to the system's subsystems. — location: [749]() ^ref-29852

---
They are just as likely to identify any other parts of the system, like this : — location: [751]() ^ref-22115

---
accommodation — location: [754]() ^ref-10083

---
chestnuts — location: [755]() ^ref-63716

---
subsidiary — location: [758]() ^ref-30019

---
We define a concept in extension when we specify all the elements of the class it refers to. And we define a concept in intension when we try to explain its meaning analytically in terms of other concepts at the same level. — location: [759]() ^ref-2424

---
conjunction — location: [764]() ^ref-60846

---
each of the concepts "acoustics " and "neighborhood " is a variable whose value extension is the same as that given by the conjunction of all the value extensions of the specific acoustic variables, or the specific community-living variables, respectively.l6 — location: [763]() ^ref-4030

---
in practice, as a rule, concepts are not generated or defined in extension; they are generated in intension . That is, we fit new concepts into the pattern of everyday language by relating their meanings to those of other words at present available in English. — location: [765]() ^ref-3366

---
Take the concept "safety, " for example. Its existence as a common word is convenient and helps hammer home the very general importance of keeping designs dangerfree. But it is used in the statement of such dissimilar problems as the design of a tea kettle and the design of a highway interchange. As far as its meaning is concerned it is relevant to both. But as far as the individual structure of the two problems goes — location: [770]() ^ref-35789

---
although every problem has its own structure, and there are many different problems, the words we have available to describe the components of these problems are generated by forces in the language, not by the problems, and are therefore rather limited in number and cannot describe more than a few cases correctly. — location: [774]() ^ref-57384

---
the principles which define them - acoustics, circulation, weather, neighborhood - happen to be part of current architectural usage, not because they bear a well-understood fundamental relation to any particular problem being investigated. — location: [785]() ^ref-34577

---
The complexity of the problem is never fully disentangled — location: [787]() ^ref-17605

---
they begin seriously to impair our ability — location: [793]() ^ref-55335

---
The arbitrariness of the existing verbal concepts is not their only disadvantage, for once they are invented, verbal concepts have a further ill-effect on us. We lose the ability to modify them. — location: [790]() ^ref-24185

---
In the unselfconscious situation the action of culture on form is a very subtle business, made up of many minute concrete influences. But once these concrete influences are represented symbolically in verbal terms, and these symbolic representations or names subsumed under larger and still more abstract categories to make them amenable to thought, they begin seriously to impair our ability to see beyond them — location: [791]() ^ref-14652

---
Where a number of issues are being taken into account in a design decision, inevitably the ones which can be most clearly expressed carry the greatest weight, and are best reflected in the form. — location: [794]() ^ref-63984

---
Caught in a net of language of our own invention, we overestimate the language's impartiality. — location: [796]() ^ref-33493

---
We take the step from description to criterion too easily, so that what is at first a useful tool becomes a bigoted preoccupation. — location: [797]() ^ref-63255

---
functionalist doctrine — location: [799]() ^ref-35588

---
monetary values had explicitly been given great importance through the concept "economics — location: [800]() ^ref-44284

---
The Roman bias toward functionalism and engineering did not reach its peak until after Vitruvius had formulated the functionalist doctrine.21 The Parthenon could only have been created during a time of preoccupation with aesthetic problems, after the earlier Greek invention of the concept "beauty. " — location: [798]() ^ref-37253

---
-perpetuating — location: [802]() ^ref-44106

---
In this fashion the selfconscious individual's grasp of problems is constantly misled. His concepts and categories, besides being arbitrary and unsuitable, are self-perpetuating. — location: [801]() ^ref-16118

---
Under the influence of concepts, he not only does things from a biased point of view, but sees them biasedly as well. The concepts control his perception of fit and misfit- until in the end he sees nothing but deviations from his conceptual dogmas, and loses not only the urge but even the mental opportunity to frame his problems more appropriately. — location: [803]() ^ref-47353

---
thwarted — location: [810]() ^ref-34918

---
our attempts to duplicate the natural organization of the unselfconscious process selfconsciously are thwarted, because the very thoughts we have, as we try to help ourselves, distort the problem and make it too unclear to solve . — location: [809]() ^ref-12860

---
As time goes on — location: [811]() ^ref-25203

---
To solve a problem by selection, two things are necessary. It must be possible to generate a wide enough range of possible alternative solutions symbolically. It must be possible to express all the criteria for solution in terms of the same symbolism. — location: [815]() ^ref-27513

---
It is at once obvious that wherever this kind of process is possible, we do not need to " design " a solution. — location: [819]() ^ref-32542

---
we might almost claim that a problem only calls for design (in the widest sense of that word) when selection cannot be used to solve it. — location: [820]() ^ref-11348

---
radically — location: [823]() ^ref-22200

---
we do not know how to express the criteria for success in terms of any symbolic description of a form. In other words, given a new design, there is often no mechanical way of telling, purely from the drawings which describe it, whether or not it meets its requirements. — location: [824]() ^ref-55670

---
to predict from the drawings whether it will work or not. — location: [827]() ^ref-48166

---
the construction of hypotheses demands the further introduction of principles like simplicity (Occam's razor) , non-arbitrariness, and clear organization. — location: [831]() ^ref-52514

---
The construct ion of form, — location: [832]() ^ref-37034

---
inventive capacity — location: [834]() ^ref-42061

---
If theory cannot be expected to invent form, how is it likely to be useful to a designer? — location: [835]() ^ref-45888

---
I shall contrast three possible kinds of design process, schematically — location: [836]() ^ref-64148

---
Here the process which shapes the form is a complex two-directional interaction between the context Cl and the form Fl , in the world itself. The human being is only present as an agent in this process. He reacts to misfits by changing them ; but is unlikely to impose any " designed " conception on the form — location: [839]() ^ref-22138

---
form is shaped not by interaction between the actual context's demands and the actual inadequacies of the form, but by a conceptual interaction between the conceptual picture of the context which the designer has learned and invented, on the one hand, and ideas and diagrams and drawings which stand for forms, on the other. — location: [842]() ^ref-51126

---
This interaction contains both the probing in which the designer searches the problem for its major " issues, " and the development of forms which satisfy them — location: [844]() ^ref-32159

---
In the unselfconscious process there is no possibility of misconstruing the situation : nobody makes a picture of the context, so the picture cannot be wrong. But the selfconscious designer works entirely from the picture in his mind, and this picture is almost always wrong. — location: [848]() ^ref-8147

---
which eradicates 7 7 its bias and retains only its abstract structural features — location: [850]() ^ref-23913

---
in a way not subject to the bias of language and experience. — location: [851]() ^ref-53668

---
The vague and unsatisfactory picture of the context's demands, C2, which first develops in the designer's mind, is followed by this mathematical picture, C3. — location: [852]() ^ref-51507

---
The derivation of these diagrams F3 from C3, though still intuitive, may be clearly understood. — location: [854]() ^ref-40144

---
A collection of riddles in a book forms a set — location: [857]() ^ref-58928

---
A set, just as its name suggests, is any collection of things whatever, without regard to common properties, and has no internal structure until it is given one. — location: [856]() ^ref-54362

---

Every form can be described in two ways : from the point of view of what it is, and from the point of view of what it does. What it is is sometimes called the formal description.

---
It is the aim of science to give such a unified description for every object and phenomenon we know. The task of chemistry (and it has been remarkably successful in this) is to relate functional and formal descriptions of chemical compounds to one another, so that we can go backwards and forwards between the two, without loss in understanding. — location: [974]() ^ref-1753

---
The constructive diagram can describe the context, and it can describe the form. It offers us a way of probing the context, and a way of searching for form. Because it manages to do both simultaneously, it offers us a bridge between requirements and form, and therefore is a most important tool in the process of design. — location: [996]() ^ref-28055

---
these diagrams are no more than stages on the way to the specification of a form, — location: [1000]() ^ref-62306

In all design tasks the designer has to translate sets of requirements into diagrams which capture their physical implications. In a literal sense these diagrams are no more than stages on the way to the specification of a form, — location: [999]() ^ref-27231

constructive diagram is not only useful in probing the more obvious, known aspects of a problem like circulation, but that it can also be used to create the newly discovered implications of a new problem. — location: [1003]() ^ref-52860

---
Are there some simpler diagrams which the designer can construct, and which will contribute substantially to his ability to find a diagram for M? There are; and the program tells us how to find them. The program is a hierarchy of the most significant subsets of M. Each subset is a subproblem with its own integrity. — location: [1010]() ^ref-30436

---
In the program the smallest sets fall together in larger sets; and these in turn again in larger sets. Each subset can be translated into a constructive diagram. And each of these subsets of M, because it contains fewer requirements than M itself, and less interaction between them, is simpler to diagram than M. — location: [1012]() ^ref-31749

---
If we build up compound diagrams from these simplest diagrams according to the program's structure, and build up further compound diagrams from these in turn, we get a tree of diagrams. — location: [1015]() ^ref-35642

---
This tree of diagrams contains just one diagram for each set of requirements in the program's tree. We call it the realization of the program. — location: [1016]() ^ref-21262

---
Program, consisting of sets Realization, consisting of diagrams — location: [1018]() ^ref-6685

---
As we see on the left, the tree of sets is obtained by successive division and partition. The tree of diagrams, on the right, is made by successive composition and fusion. At its apex is the last diagram, which captures the full implications of the whole problem, and is therefore the complete diagram for the form required. — location: [1019]() ^ref-36619

one of the designer's first tasks will be to strip the problem of the preconceptions which such names introduce. — location: [1030]() ^ref-19351

the problem is only defined within rather broad limits. — location: [1026]() ^ref-12180

---
the set M consists of all those possible kinds of misfit which might occur between the form and the context; — location: [1031]() ^ref-8670

---
each element of M is a variable which can be in one of two states: fit and misfit.2 It is important to remember that the state of this variable depends on the entire.ensemble. — location: [1033]() ^ref-15072

---
We cannot decide whether a misfit has occurred either by looking at the form alone, or by looking at the context alone. Misfit is a condition of the ensemble as a whole, which comes from the unsatisfactory interaction of the form and context. — location: [1034]() ^ref-41606

---
Out of context, the kettle's price either exceeds or does not exceed various figures we can name: nothing more. Only its relation to the rest of the ensemble makes it " too expensive" or " all right." In other words, it depends on how much we can afford. — location: [1038]() ^ref-32717

---
We can set up such a performance standard for every misfit variable that exhibits continuous variation along a welldefined scale. — location: [1052]() ^ref-45162

---
Once a scale like this has been found for a requirement, it is then almost always possible to find a connection between this scale and some intrinsic property of the form — location: [1056]() ^ref-33426

---
the existence of a performance standard, and the association of a numerical scale with a misfit variable, does not mean that the misfit is any more keenly felt in tht: ensemble when it occurs. — location: [1061]() ^ref-7418

---
No one has yet invented a scale for unhappiness or discomfort or uneasiness, and it is therefore not possible to set up performance standards for them. Yet these misfits are among the most critical which occur in design problems. — location: [1064]() ^ref-57062

---
A design problem is not an optimization problem. — location: [1069]() ^ref-50431

---
although it is certainly true that the use of performance standards makes it less necessary for a designer to rely on personal experience, it also happens that the kind of mathematical optimization which quantifiable variables make possible is largely irrelevant to the design problem. — location: [1067]() ^ref-33265

---
For most requirements it is important only to satisfy them at a level which suffices to prevent misfit between the form and the context, and to do this in the least arbitrary manner possible. — location: [1071]() ^ref-56035

---
This is a strictly binary situation. — location: [1072]() ^ref-5555

---
The natural scale of capacity measurement provides an objective basis for dividing kettles into those which fit the context in this respect, and those which don't. For nonquantifiable variables, it is not quite so easy. — location: [1079]() ^ref-64816

---
How can we get an exhaustive set of variables M for a given problem; in other words, how can we be sure we haven't left out some important issue? — location: [1088]() ^ref-51029

For any specific variable, how do we decide at what point misfit occurs; or if it is a continuous variable, how do we know what value to set as a performance IOO standard? In other words, how do we recognize the condition so far described as misfit? — location: [1090]() ^ref-18480

---
These questions have already been answered, substantially — location: [1092]() ^ref-60430

---
Any state of affairs in the ensemble which derives from the interaction between form and context, and causes stress in the ensemble, is a misfit. — location: [1093]() ^ref-7983

---
We may find precedents for this in the practice of common law, — location: [1095]() ^ref-64663

---
This concept of stress or misfit is a primitive one. We shall proceed without defining it. — location: [1094]() ^ref-2118

---
if somebody suggests that the ensemble is stressed if the kettle wiil not reflect ultraviolet radiation, common sense tells us to reject thisunless some special reason can be given, which shows what damage the absorption of ultraviolet does to the ensemble. — location: [1100]() ^ref-42534

---
it is clearly not possible to list all the types of stress which might occur in an ensemble exhaustively, and therefore impossible to hope that M could provide an exhaustive description of a problem. — location: [1103]() ^ref-29457

---
Even if we try to design something for an entirely new purpose that has never been conceived before, the best we can do in stating the problem is to anticipate how it might possibly go wrong by scanning mentally all the ways in which other things have gone wrong in the past — location: [1105]() ^ref-12442

---
The errors that seem most critical to one person will not be the same as those which seem most critical to another. Any list of errors or misfits, which are to be removed, therefore necessarily has something of a personal flavor. — location: [1110]() ^ref-3113

---
Probably each designer has his private set of hunches — location: [1113]() ^ref-63962

---
The designer is free to look at a problem in any way he chooses; all we can hope to do is to put a fruitful structure on his view of it. It is for this reason that M cannot be thought of as objectively complete, and has been presented, instead, in Chapter 6, as a picture of a designer's view of a problem. — location: [1114]() ^ref-63925

---
the domain of forms for which these variables are defined. Let us call it D. This domain D may be thought of roughly as the set of all those discriminable forms (good and bad) which might possibly be placed in contact with the given context to complete the ensemble. — location: [1125]() ^ref-20794

---
The contents of this domain cannot be specified precisely (if they could, the design problem would become a selection problem); — location: [1127]() ^ref-59834

---
the do- mam is imaginary, but serves to anchor the idea of intervariable connections. — location: [1128]() ^ref-48423

---
We should think of it as the totality of possible forms within the cognitive reach of the designer. In other words, it is a shorthand way of talking about all those discriminable forms which a designer can imagine and design. — location: [1129]() ^ref-12406

---
we know by postulate, that we can in principle decide, for each one of the forms in D, which requirements it meets, and which it fails to meet. — location: [1130]() ^ref-23558

---
If we superimpose all m variables — location: [1133]() ^ref-30578

This means that each misfit variable xi cuts the domain D in two: into a set of those forms which fit, and a set of those which don't. — location: [1131]() ^ref-45972

---
the conflict between the need for sufficient capacity in the kettle and the need for economical storage space. The first calls for large volume, the second for small volume. This conflict exists almost by definition, at least until one is thinking of ways of heating water that are very much unlike kettlesP — location: [1161]() ^ref-51041

---
Other correlations depend on physical laws -like the conflict between the need for a material which keeps the heat in after the kettle has boiled and the need for a material which allows the kettle water to be heated cheaply. — location: [1163]() ^ref-8219

---
we want to avoid muddling this last kind of case — location: [1170]() ^ref-15252

---
other correlations will depend only on accidents of present taste and habit. If you look at kettles in the shops today, you might notice that the cheap ones have tin handles, and you might conclude that the need for safety when you pick up a hot kettle (that is, for a handle which doesn't burn you) conflicts with the economics of production and the need to keep down capital cost. However, this conclusion, being based on a sample of presently available kettles, will change as soon as we begin to think of other materials and designs. — location: [1165]() ^ref-46947

---
To avoid the bias we should need either to examine all the members of D exhaustively or to find a theory which offers us a way of sampling D unbiasedly. Neither of these is practicable today. — location: [1173]() ^ref-11677

because we "understand" the connection between the two variables, we call it causal, and give it much greater weight -because we are convinced that it holds for almost all conceivable possibilities. — location: [1181]() ^ref-57757

there is no point in telling him that the conflict is spurious; — location: [1192]() ^ref-4699

---
two variables interact if and only if the designer can find some reason (or conceptual model) which makes sense to him and tells him why they should do so.15 Again, as with the definition of the variables, this introduces a personal bias, and reminds us that L, like M, is a picture of the way the designer sees the problem, not an objective description of the problem itself. — location: [1187]() ^ref-23187

---
how such a process, in which both the requirements and the links between requirements are defined by the designer from things already present in his mind, can possibly have any outcome which is not also already present in the designer's mind. In other words, how can all this process really be helpful? The answer is that, because it concentrates on structure, the process is able to make a coherent and therefore new whole out of incoherent pieces. — location: [1196]() ^ref-1251

In order to define links between requirements, he must be aware of the many specific ways in which these physical implications are likely to conflict and to concur. — location: [1200]() ^ref-23211

Plainly these have different degrees of significance, — location: [1232]() ^ref-60932

We cannot admit "economically satisfactory" as one requirement, and "maintenance costs low enough" as another. Plainly these have different degrees of significance, because the second is part of the first, while the first is not part of the second. — location: [1231]() ^ref-18355

Every design which is economically satisfactory must a fortiori have acceptable maintenance costs. But the reverse is not true. — location: [1233]() ^ref-46814

---
their probabilities of occurrence are very unequal. — location: [1234]() ^ref-14461

---
the difference would be just as great if we replaced the first by "functionally satisfactory." This is again wider in scope and significance than "maintenance costs low enough" even though it does not contain it. If we want to use "maintenance costs low enough" as one requirement, then we must break down "functionally satisfactory" into smaller, more specific requirements, comparable to it. — location: [1236]() ^ref-49704

---
The first step in constructing the set M is to make all its variables approximately equal in "size" or scope. — location: [1238]() ^ref-45797

---
One way to bring this out would be by the following rearrangement, which covers more or less the same ground as the first pair, but consists of two more independent variables. "The kettle must permit one-way heat transmission only." "The kettle must have low thermal capacity. — location: [1244]() ^ref-31390

---
in practice, though, is that we must be satisfied that all the variables are as independent as we can get them to be. — location: [1241]() ^ref-27341

---
A considerable amount of energy must be spent in the preliminary stages shuffling and reshuffling the variables in this fashion, until they are as independent as they can be made. — location: [1246]() ^ref-8485

---
Since the state of one variable is most likely to affect the correlation between other variables, if that one variable is wide in scope the best we can do in satisfying this is to make all the individual variables as specific and minute as possible. — location: [1249]() ^ref-35598

---
we may try to steer clear of existing categories, in practice we shall always have to generate the specific variables of M through intermediate stages. — location: [1252]() ^ref-29441

---
Whether we like it or not, if we think of one variable which has to do with acoustics, we shall inevitably then think of others which seem, to us, to fall under the same heading or to be in the same conceptual area. It is therefore a matter of practical psychology that we cannot a void using superordinate concepts like "economics" and "acoustics" altogether, as intermediate steps in the task of listing misfit variables. — location: [1253]() ^ref-3813

---
The closer our variables are to these abstract and general key words, the more susceptible the problem remains to the kind of distortions discussed in Chapter 5.

properties the elements of M must have. They must be chosen (1) to be of equal scope, (2) to be as independent of one another as is reasonably possible, and (3) to be as small in scope and hence as specific and detailed and numerous as possible. — location: [1260]() ^ref-43293

S1 and S2 are two different sets of requirements. S3 contains all the requirements in sl and s2 together. — location: [1291]() ^ref-54680

First we must be able to find constructive diagrams for S1 and S2 individually. This means that the misfits which S1 contains must cohere somehow, and suggest a physical aspect or component of the form under consideration; and the same for s2. — location: [1294]() ^ref-17604

it must be possible to derive a constructive diagram — location: [1296]() ^ref-56994

the first of these conditions depends on the internal structure of the sets sl and s2, while the second deals with the relations between these two sets. — location: [1298]() ^ref-2823

"The kettle must be comfortable for the hand to hold," and "The kettle must be economical to heat," which we should probably consider as noninteracting. These two define a two-element subset of M for the kettle problem. — location: [1302]() ^ref-33085

---
The use of verbal concepts is an efficient artificial way of finding sets which have something in common. — location: [1309]() ^ref-40907

---
Unfortunately, the sets of misfits identified by verbal concepts do not have any special functional significance, and do not usually lend themselves particularly well to interpretation through constructive diagrams. — location: [1312]() ^ref-32004

---
A constructive diagram requires that the requirements it represents have some physical implications in common. From this point of view, it is easy to see that not all the possible subsets of M will be equally easy to diagram constructively. — location: [1313]() ^ref-64188

---
some subsets open up physical possibilities more readily than others. — location: [1315]() ^ref-36217

---
Where, after all, does the interaction among the requirements spring from? — location: [1319]() ^ref-11170

---
If we are to make anything sensible of the subsets in this program, we must now ask just which sets of points to consider as being the most " diagrammable. " This depends on the pattern of interactions between the misfits. — location: [1318]() ^ref-45269

---
Two misfits are seen to interact only because, in some sense at least, they deal with the same kind of physical consideration. If they dealt with utterly different aspects, there could be no basis either for conflict or for concurrence. — location: [1320]() ^ref-7629

---
It is such a physical center of implication, if I may call it that, which the designer finds it easy to grasp. Because it refers to a distinguishable physical property or entity, it can be expressed diagrammatically, and provides a possible nonverbal point of entry into the problem. If we can find sets of variables in which there are specially dense interactions, we may assume, in these cases, that the density of the interaction resides in a particularly strong identifiable physical aspect of the problem. These sets will be the easiest of all to grasp constructively. — location: [1326]() ^ref-48853

---
If, therefore, we break the problem apart in such a way that its clusters of variables are as richly connected, internally, as possible, we shall have clues to those physical aspects of the problem which play the most important functional part in the problem and are therefore most likely to furnish handles for the designer's comprehension. These are the sets which will be the easiest to diagram. — location: [1330]() ^ref-48232

---
If we are to solve the problem M by working our way through the program, solving various subproblems separately, it must obviously be possible to put the resulting diagrams together somehow when we have them. — location: [1333]() ^ref-65009

---
The physical characteristics demanded by one requirement conflict with the physical characteristics demanded by another. This is, in fact, exactly what we mean by saying that two misfit variables conflict — location: [1337]() ^ref-54894

---
a subset which contained all the economic variables and no others, for example, would be comparatively useless, because its economic implications conflict too strongly with the other implications of the problem. Naturally if the diagram for the economic requirements is not going to be compatible with that for the comfort requirements, say, there is no point in constructing the two diagrams independently. — location: [1339]() ^ref-3654

---
we cannot avoid encountering the conflicts somewhere in the program. No matter in what order we consider the requirements, if we are to find a form which satisfies them all, we must at some stage resolve each one of the conflicts. — location: [1342]() ^ref-57418

---
the later in the process conflicting diagrams have to be integrated, the more difficult the integration is. Naturally, then, since the conflicts have to be resolved sooner or later, we should like to meet them as early in the process of realization as we can, while our ideas are still flexible. From this point of view, the fewer links there are between the major subsets of the decomposition, the better. — location: [1348]() ^ref-23399

---
we can grasp diagrammatically calls for sets of variables whose internal interactions are very rich. — location: [1352]() ^ref-59824

---
The need to resolve the conflicts between the diagrams we get from them calls for as little interaction between subsets as possible. Clearly these two are compatible; indeed, they can be expressed jointly as follows. — location: [1353]() ^ref-35091

---
Consider just one level of the decomposition, where some set S is to be partitioned into disjoint subsets (S1, S2 · · ·Sa · · · Sl') . We wish to choose these Sa in such a way that we can invent a constructive diagram for sl whose implications will not later turn out to be hopelessly contradicted by an independently conceived diagram for one of the other Sa; and the same for S2, S3, etcetera. — location: [1355]() ^ref-54770

---
The sparser the links between the Sa, the less the values of the variables in S1 can tell us about the values in Sz, etc.; the less information the links carry across the partition, the freer we are to construct a diagram for s2 once we have fixed the solution of sl in our minds. — location: [1361]() ^ref-25268

---
we must choose the Sa in such a way that the variables in different subsets of the partition exercise as little informational constraint on one another as possible. — location: [1365]() ^ref-47403

---
we first find that partition of M, 1r(M) , for which R( 7r) is minimum. This establishes the first level of the decomposition, thus, say: We then apply the same method to the sets Sa : we look for that partition 7r(S1) of St , for which R(7r) is minimum, and similarly for S2 , thus obtaining the second level of the • • · decomposition. We continue with this procedure iteratively, until we reach a level of decomposition at which all the sets contain one variable only. — location: [1371]() ^ref-3763

---
The tree of sets this decomposition gives is, within the terms of this book, a complete structural description of the design problem defined by M; and it therefore serves as a program for the synthesis of a form which solves this problem. — location: [1374]() ^ref-46271

The tree is, in its hierarchical form, the same as any other hierarchy of concepts - except that the concepts are here defined extensionally as sets of variables, rather than intensionally by meaning. — location: [1376]() ^ref-11888

The particular tree arrived at by the method outlined gives an explicit description of the structure implicitly responsible for the success and stability of the unselfconscious form-making process. — location: [1378]() ^ref-34556

---
The tree gives the strongest possible decomposition of the problem that does not interfere with the task of synthesizing its parts in a unified way. Each subsidiary problem it defines has its own integrity, and is as independent as it can be of the rest of the problem. — location: [1379]() ^ref-61734

We must remember that the hierarchy of sets which the tree defines will not always be easy to understand. — location: [1381]() ^ref-37853

we may establish a measure of information transfer or informational dependence among these subsets, called R( 1r) . — location: [1368]() ^ref-25879

---
Since the potential coherence of such a set of variables comes from its physical implications, it can only be grasped graphically, by means of a constructive diagram that brings out these implications. Each diagram for a set S must do two things : As a requirement diagram: a. It must bring out just those features of the problem which are relevant to this set of requirements. b. It must include no information which is not explicitly called for by these requirements. — location: [1384]() ^ref-27753

---
As a form diagram: a. It must be so specific that it has all the physical characteristics called for by the requirements of S. b. Yet it must be so general that it contains no arbitrary characteristics, and so summarizes, abstractly, the nature of every form which might satisfy S. — location: [1387]() ^ref-316

---
the designer must resist the temptation to summarize the contents of the tree in terms of wellknown verbal concepts. He must not expect to be able to see for every S some verbal paradigm like " This one deals with the acoustic aspects of the form." — location: [1389]() ^ref-54978

The effect of the design program is that each set of requirements draws his attention to just one major physical and functional issue, rather than to some verbal or preconceived issue. — location: [1392]() ^ref-12903

Scientists try to identify the components of existing structure. Designers try to shape the components of new structures. The search for the right components, and the right way to build the form up from these components, is the greatest physical challenge faced by the designer. — location: [1414]() ^ref-5323

---
Every aspect of a form, whether piecelike or patternlike, can be understood as a structure of components. Every object is a hierarchy of components, the large ones specifying the pattern of distribution of the smaller ones, the small ones themselves, though at first sight more clearly piecelike, in fact again patterns specifying the arrangement and distribution of still smaller components — location: [1424]() ^ref-43763
