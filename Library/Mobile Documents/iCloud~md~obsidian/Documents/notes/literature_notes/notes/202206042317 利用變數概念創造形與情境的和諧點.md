[[《Notes on the Synthesis of Form》]]

We may summarize the state of each potential misfit by means of a binary variable. If the misfit occurs, we say the variable takes the value 1. If the misfit does not occur, we say the variable takes the value 0.

The task of design is not to create form which meets certain conditions, but to create such an order in the ensemble that all the variables take the value 0. The form is simply that part of the ensemble over which we have control. It is only through the form that we can create order in the ensemble.
