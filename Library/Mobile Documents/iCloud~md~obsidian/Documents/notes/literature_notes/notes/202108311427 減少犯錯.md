- Keep the dog on leash, even if you have a fenced yard, and spend time letting him sniff around and eliminate if he’s so inclined. It’s common for dogs who are a bit nervous not to urinate in unfamiliar places, so be patient; if he won’t pee, take him inside but keep a close eye on him. (Page 2)

狗狗第一次踏進新家時，讓狗狗盡情探索，但保持上繩。先讓狗狗在戶外尿尿舒壓一下，避免到了室內忍不住尿尿。如果狗狗在戶外太緊張不肯尿，帶回室內就要更加注意狗狗要上廁所的徵兆。
