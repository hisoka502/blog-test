- wait to enroll your dog in group classes until you know him better; group classes can be frightening to dogs, especially if they have not been well-socialized, so work privately with a trainer if need be before taking the dog to a class.
如果想帶狗狗去上訓練客，最好先確定和狗狗已經彼此認識建立默契了。而上課前也一定要經過訓練師的評估，確認狗狗的狀況是否適合什麼課程。
