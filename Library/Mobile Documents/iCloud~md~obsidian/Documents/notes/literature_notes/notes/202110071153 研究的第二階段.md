[[《Can Dogs Tell When We're Lying to Them》]]
- dogs watched another person move the food from the first bowl to another bowl in two situations: (1) the communicator was present, saw what was happening, and knew the food had been moved from the original bowl; and (2) when the communicator wasn't there, didn't see the switch, and thought the food was still in the original bowl. The important point in these experiments was that the original dog bowl was now empty, and the dogs knew that the communicator either saw the switch or didn't see it, so either they were telling the truth when they told the dogs where the food was, or they were lying about the location of the food.
 實驗的下一個階段加入了第三者，他會分別在兩種情境下，把零食從A碗移到B碗。
      情境一：第三者當著狗狗和溝通者的面移動食物。這個情境之下，大家都知道食物被換了位置。
      情境二：第三者在狗狗面前移動食物，但溝通者不在現場。這個情境中，溝通者是唯一一個狀況外，不知道食物被換了位置的人。
      接下來，如果讓情境一與情境二的溝通者重複最一開始的動作，指出A碗裡頭有食物。
      在情境一中，我們會知道溝通者在「說謊」，因為零食被移到B碗的當下，大家都親眼目睹了。但在情境二中，溝通者因為被蒙在鼓裡，以為零食仍然在A碗裡，所以我們會說他是「不知情」，而不是在騙人。
