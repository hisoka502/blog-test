[[《Does Another Dog in the House Reduce Separation Anxiety》]]
> When it comes to vocalizations, overall female dogs bark less when home alone. They are noisier if there was another dog in the house. However the highest levels of barking and other vocalizations are found in the male dogs that are in a multi-dog household.

母狗獨處時比較不會這麼常吠叫，但有其他狗狗在時就會比較吵。
但是頻率最高的吠叫和各種聲音則是公狗在多狗環境中發出來的。
