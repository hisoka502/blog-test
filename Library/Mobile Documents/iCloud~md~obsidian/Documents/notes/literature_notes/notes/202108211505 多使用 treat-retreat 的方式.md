reference：[[《Decompression 9 Ways to Help Your New Rescue Dog Adjust to a New Life 1》]]

Try tossing little bits of chicken or hot dog in his general direction.  Being the chicken person is a good thing!  Every person he meets should be a chicken party, tossing (NOT reaching to hand deliver) him lots of chicken or other high value food, to help create an association that new people are awesome.

可以使用丟零食的方式，不要直接餵食，幫狗狗建立好印象。
