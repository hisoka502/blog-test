[[《Does Another Dog in the House Reduce Separation Anxiety》]]

> dogs living with a pal are not calmer than dogs living alone. Once again, the scientific data does not support the "obvious," popular, and simple interpretation of how dogs should behave.

> Thus contrary to expectations that a dog with a companion will be calmer, having another dog in the house seems to actually increase separation anxiety symptoms.

這個研究的結果讓我們知道狗狗和同伴住在一起並不會變得比較冷靜。但這研究僅只於外顯的行為，沒辦法解釋狗狗分離焦慮真正的情緒與行為。

但大體而言，多一隻狗狗反而可能增加分離焦慮的吠叫等「症狀」。
