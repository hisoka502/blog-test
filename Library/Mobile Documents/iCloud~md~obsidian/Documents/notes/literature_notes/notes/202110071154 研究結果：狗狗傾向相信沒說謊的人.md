- Around 66 percent of the dogs trusted the honest suggestions of false-believing communicators who hadn't seen the food being moved. In contrast, only about 50 percent of the dogs followed the misleading advice of communicators lying because they knew the food wasn't in the original container.
    - Note: 66% 的狗狗會選擇那些不知情（錯誤信念）的人，而只有 50% 的狗狗會選擇相信那些在說謊的人。
