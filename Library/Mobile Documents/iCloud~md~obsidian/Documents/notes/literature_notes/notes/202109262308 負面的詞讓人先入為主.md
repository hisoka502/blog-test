# 負面的詞讓人先入為主
[[《Choose Your Words Carefully》]]

> If you tell someone “my dog is aggressive”, they immediately assume the dog is dangerous and not a friendly dog.  It colors how that person, without even having met your dog, now sees your dog and what they expect, based on that person’s individual experience of what an “aggressive dog” is, to them.  And, this affects how you see your dog too.  If instead, you said “my dog is fearful and is afraid of new people,” it communicates understanding and empathy.

直接用負面的形容詞去描述狗狗，也很容易會影響別人對狗狗的看法，先入為主地認為狗狗很危險。這樣的形容也會讓自己看待狗狗的角度。  
描述狗狗的原始情緒，才能讓我們更加同理狗狗。
