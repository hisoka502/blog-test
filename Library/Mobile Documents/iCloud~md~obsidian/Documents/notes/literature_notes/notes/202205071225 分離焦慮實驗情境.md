[[《Does Another Dog in the House Reduce Separation Anxiety》]]
This study involved setting up three video cameras in each home. These were pointed to the places where the dogs usually stay during separation.
The sample consisted of 32 dogs in single dog homes and 45 dogs in multi-dog households, all of whom were left in the house alone as part of their usual routine.

實驗組包含了 32 組獨處狗狗，以及 45 組多狗家庭。獨處實驗過程都是拍攝日常的行程。
