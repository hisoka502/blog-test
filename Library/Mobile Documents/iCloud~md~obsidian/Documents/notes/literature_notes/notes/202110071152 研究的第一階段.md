[[《Can Dogs Tell When We're Lying to Them》]]
the dogs were first trained to find food hidden in one of two covered bowls and to follow the advice of an unfamiliar human (the communicator). During the familiarization phase, when the communicator touched the bowl in which the food was located, looked at the dog, and said, "Look, this is good, this is very good," the dogs came to trust them.
 訓練狗狗從兩個碗中間，找到藏有零食的那一個。同時有一個陌生人扮演和溝通的角色給狗狗提示，以下就稱他為溝通者吧。他會一邊用手碰著藏有食物的碗，一邊告訴狗狗：「這裡有好料的哦！」
當狗狗實際檢查碗，發現溝通者說的是真話後，就會開始對他產生信任。
