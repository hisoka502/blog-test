- The fact is that behavior is context-dependent, meaning that all animals with ﬂexible repertories vary their behavior in different environments. (Page 3)
- they’ve been house-trained in one location doesn’t mean they will generalize it to another. (Page 1)
- Dogs especially vary their behavior from a group setting (like a shelter or foster home with lots of dogs) to a home in which they are the only member of their own species. (Page 3)
- 行為是會根據情境改變的。狗狗原本不管在中途或收容所就算訓練得很好，根據原本照護者表示行為都很棒，到了新家後仍然會不一樣。除此之外，多狗環境以及到新家後只有一隻狗狗的表現也會不一樣。
