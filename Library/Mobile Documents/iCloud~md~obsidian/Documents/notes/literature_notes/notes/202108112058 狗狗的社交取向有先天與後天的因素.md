# 狗狗的社交取向有先天與後天的因素
狗狗在社交上對其他狗狗的行為是有許多可能性的。  
除了先天基因影響之外，後天的經驗也會養成不一樣的社交性格。

The truth is that dog tolerance levels are variable, and will change with both age and experiences (good or bad). There is also a genetic component to most dogs’ sociability with others of their own species, so all of the appropriate socialization in the world will not necessarily make every dog socially adept and friendly.
