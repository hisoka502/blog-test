>Writer's block is a myth. What people get stuck on. It's not that they're out of ideas. It's that they think they're out of good ideas, that everyone has bad ideas. And my only argument is if you put enough bad ideas into the world, sooner or later your brain will wake up and good ideas will come and that the bad boss problem is your bad boss won't let you ship anything because he or she is insisting on perfect.

爛點子絕對不能只停留在大腦和紙筆上。不斷向市場拋出夠多爛點子，才能讓好點子快點誕生。
