Learning English with Podcasts

---

I started to listen podcasts to improving my English listening and speaking abilities since last year. 

There are two types of podcasts I listen to mainly; Podcasts hosted by native speakers with the topics I interested like business, startups, self-help...etc. Another one are the Podcasts which are made to be English learning tutorials produced by teachers.

there is a quote "Read what you love until you love to read."  I followed it at the very beginning when I choose what podcasts to listen. So I picked up the podcasts like The Tim Ferriss Show, How I Built This. Although I only could understand about 70% what the hosts said , but I still pretty enjoy them. After finishing few episodes, I stopped listening to that kinds of podcasts. Why? Because the hosts talked with normal speed, I had to be very focus on listening. That made my brain occupied so it was hard for me to do the "shadowing practice" at the same time.

I want to imrpove my English speaking, as a results I decided to try some English learning podcasts and saw if I could learned more. The result was really beyond my expectation when I could follow the hosts' clear pronunciation to speak. Now, the Podcast I spend most time listen to is called "Culips". The podcast itself is free for all, but they also offer a paid membership which gives the members detailed transcript and extra tutorals for speaking practice. I'm ready to pay for the exclusive stuffs.
