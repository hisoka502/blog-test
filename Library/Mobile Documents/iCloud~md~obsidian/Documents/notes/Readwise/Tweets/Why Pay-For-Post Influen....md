> When influencer marketing first emerged in the early 2010s, it was one of the best things to invest your money into as a brand. 
> You’re going direct to the audience that you need to reach (no matter how niche) for a minimal amount of $. 
> It was revolutionary. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338347121422336))



> When dealing with macro-influencers on IG and YouTube, you were reaching the same amount of eyeballs as you would with primetime TV for 1/100th of the cost. 
> The economics were too good to be true. 
> Things started to change for the worse in 2018-2020. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338348434194432))



> In 2022, prices have caught up directly to what you’d expect from a TV commercial. 
> DTC brands are using VC money to pay influencers up to $500k for a post on IG or YouTube, even if it’s not profitable. 
> This created a domino effect. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338349772201984))



> I personally know influencers that are making 8 figures a year from sponsorships. 
> Most people wouldn’t be able to turn down a $500k wire transfer for a 2-minute ad on social media. 
> Now, influencers don’t choose their sponsors based on what they love and use. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338351093469184))



> They choose sponsors based on check size. 
> This means influencers promote crypto pump-and-dumps, products that suck, or they have competing brands on back-to-back ad spots. 
> People are losing trust in influencers for this reason. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338352427171840))



> The main point of IM is that you can buy the products that your favorite influencers love. 
> Now, the only reason these products are being promoted is because the check had enough zeroes. 
> That’s not a good selling point in the eyes of the audience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338353773543429))



> Our method of influencer marketing eliminates this over-inflated price tag, keeps the element of trust, and adds infinitely more value to all parties compared to the pay-for-post model. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338355161931776))



> With influencer seeding, we create genuine relationships with influencers…
> Gift them products that we think they’ll love…
> They post about it (without having to ask)...
> And we incentivize them to stick with us long-term. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cody_Wittick/status/1530338356529205248))
