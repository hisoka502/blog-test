## Highlights
> A Netflix user will browse the app for 90 seconds and leave if they find nothing. 
> Thumbnail artwork is actually NFLX's most effective lever to influence a viewer's choice. A user will look at one for only 1.8 seconds, so NFLX spends huge to optimize them.
> Here's a breakdown🧵

> 1/ Spoiler alert: humans are visual animals. 
> Our eyes move 3-4x per second to process information and we can analyze an image in as little as 13 milliseconds. https://t.co/AAyc7PUPFa ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1445768099358146561))



> 2/ In 2014, Netflix consumer research showed that thumbnail artwork:
> ◻️ is "the biggest influencer...to watch content"
> ◻️ is the focus of 82% of browsing time 
> A user looks at one for only 1.8 seconds. If they can't find Netflix content in 90 seconds, they'll leave the app.

> 3/ Consequently, Netflix uses an elaborate thumbnail selection process for each of its 200m+ users.
> The process is called aestethic visual analysis (AVA), which starts by pulling all the frames from a video.
> For reference: a 1hr episode of "Stranger Things" has 86k frames.

> 4/ In a process known as "Frame Annotation", each frame is tagged with metadata identifying key variables:
> ◻️ Saliency
> ◻️ Frame #
> ◻️ Brightness / Contrast
> ◻️ Nudity probability
> ◻️ Face / skin tone 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBBjhoxVcAgaw9-.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1445768119859904519))



> 5/ The frames are then graded on these variables.
> ◻️ Visual (brightness, contrast, color, motion blur)
> ◻️ Contextual (face detection / shot angle)
> ◻️ Composition (photography principles like "rule of thirds", symmetry, depth of field)

> 6/ The next step is "Image Ranking", which chooses the best thumbnails (most likely to be clicked).
> Winning traits include:
> ◻️ Expressive faces
> ◻️ Main characters
> ◻️ Brightness 
> For "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt", Netflix research showed the bottom right frame as the "winner".

> 7/ Another winning trait is good localization. 
> The best thumbnails (green arrow) for each country for the show "Sense8" had attributes most attractive to that specific region.

> 8/ Also: thumbnails with villainous characters outperform. 
> Netflix says these bad guy thumbnails (green arrow) for "Dragons: Race to the Edge" are the most clicked. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBBj2XmVQAglC7z.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1445768141452169220))



> 9/ One last finding: Netflix discovered that thumbnails with more than 3 people vastly underperform.
> Netflix applied this knowledge for the rollout of "Orange Is The New Black". Season 2 has only one character in the thumbnail (vs. an ensemble for Season 1) 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBBj5l4VQA4r465.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1445768147093508104))



> 10/ One reason Netflix started creating its own thumbnails is that the artwork provided by studios weren't optimized for the streaming app.
> The creative work Netflix received was meant for other mediums like billboards or DVD covers.

> 11/ At the most basic level, Netflix applies ML to select a thumbnail for you based on recent watch history.
> Take "Good Will Hunting" as an example:
> ◻️ Rom-com watchers get the top thumbnail ("a date")
> ◻️ Comedy fans get the bottom thumbnail (with Robin Williams)

> 11/ Here are different Netflix thumbnail selections for "Pulp Fiction": 
> ◻️ Uma Thurman fans get the top thumbnail
> ◻️ John Travolta fans get the bottom thumbnail

> 12/ Unsurprisingly, Netflix also A/B tests the thumbnails it shows users. The artwork is constantly changing.
> Here is a sample of thumbnails for the film "The Short Game" and how each performed:

> 13/ As with any ML algorithm, results can be curious. In 2018, Netflix was accused of creating artwork based on race.
> For a majority caucasian film "Like Father", one Black user was served the right image. Netflix said it makes artwork only on viewing history (not demographics).

> 14/ A less harmless example of thumbnail optimization is showcasing trending actors / actresses for content they played a smaller role in: https://t.co/CxxxojgTiR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1445768176113913862))



> 15/ Back to the Squid Game thumbnails from the 1st tweet. They don't really follow any of the artwork "rules". 
> Then again, those are only 3 that I saw out of 1000s of other options.
> And Squid Game is about to be NFLX's most popular original series ever, so something's working.

> 20/ One more factoid: Netflix’s revenue per employee is an insane $2.6m.
> More than:
> ◻️Apple ($2m) 
> ◻️Alphabet ($1.4m)
> ◻️Microsoft ($877k)
> (Apple obvi crushes profits and FCF, though)
