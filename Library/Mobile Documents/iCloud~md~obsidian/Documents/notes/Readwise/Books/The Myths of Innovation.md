## Highlights
> You don't want to “be hit over the head” with jargon and statistics.

> I promise that any “oversights” were “unintentional”



> we ‘strolled’ together under the high ceilings and bright-colored open spaces designed to encourage ’inventiveness‘.



> we saw an endless “clutter” of shared games.



> eccentrically architected private library



> I wondered whether Beethoven or Hemingway, great minds noted for thriving on conflict, could survive such a nurturing environment without “going postal.”



> my attention was “drawn to” questions from the tourists.



> I strained at the limits of trying to hear without looking like I was “eavesdropping.”

> This isn't to justify surfing instead of studying: it's only when activities are done as breaks that the change of activity pays off. Some workaholic innovators tweak this by working on multiple projects at the same time, effectively using work on one project as a break from the other.



> The other great legend of innovation and epiphany is the tale of Archimedes' Eureka. As the story goes, the great inventor Archimedes was asked by his king to detect whether a gift was made of false gold. One day, Archimedes took a bath, and on observing the displacement of water as he stepped in, he recognized a new way to look at the problem: by knowing an object's volume and weight, he could compute its density. He ran naked into the streets yelling "Eureka!"I have found it

> Natural selection doesn't mean that what's on top is special, it means only that the current environment is favorable toward that thing



> Greece and Rome didn't prevent our “clumsy” civilization-wide slide into the Dark Ages.



> The dilemma is that, at any moment, it's difficult to know whether we're witnessing progress or merely, in a hill-climbing distraction, a shortterm gain with negative long-term consequences. There have been many biological dead ends: more than 90% of all species in the history of the earth have become extinct, and that's after living for millions of years.



> Entrepreneurs are “drawn to” new markets because they have at least as good a chance as anyone else

> It would be tempting to think that there is some predetermination to the emergence of dominant design-that automobiles with internal combustion engines were somehow exactly what the gods of transportation always meant for us to have, and that earlier experiments with electric and steam powered cars were misguided aberrations destined to go nowhere. The emergence of a dominant design is not necessarily predetermined, but is the result of the interplay between technical and market choices at any particular time. (Page 29)



> that every technology, from pacemakers to contact lenses, fluorescent lights to birth control pills, arrived through the same chaos seen in the hot technologies of today. Just because dominant designs developed before we were born, or in fields so far from our own that we're ignorant of their struggles, doesn't mean their arrival was predictable, orderly, or even in our best interest. Yet, the dominant designs, the victors of any innovative (see Figure 2-4).
> pursuit, are the ones that get most of history's positive attention (Page 30)



> two leading companies, Atari and Hewlett-Packard, rejected Apple's proposal to manufacture its computer for them.27 Second, Xerox chose not to market the Alto, despite having plans in hand. Both facts seem stupid today, but that's hindsight talking; in most cases, Atari, Xerox, and HP made reasonable business decisions given the time. (Page 31)



> That happy little dot is a “shill” in the unavoidable deception that are timelines

> In those early years, browsers were so “prolific” that other software, like word processors or games, often included a web browser made by that company

> those experiments “etched” into my mind (Page 36)



> The “immutable” laws of science
