> The effect of scale depends not on a thing in itself, but in relation to its whole environment or milieu



> if we build two bridges geometrically similar, the larger is the weaker of the two,2 and is so in the ratio of their linear dimensions. It was elementary engineering experience such as this that led Herbert Spencer to apply the principle of similitude to biology.



> But it was Galileo who, wellnigh three hundred years ago, had first laid down this general principle of similitude; and he did so with the utmost possible clearness



> retaining the proportions and employing the materials which suffice in the case of a smaller structure.

> This is what is known as Froude's Law, of the correspondence of speeds-a simple and most elegant instance of ' dimensional theory'

> So likewise must there be a similar tendency among animals for the rate of supply of kinetic energy to vary with the surface of the lung, that is to say (other things being equal) with the square of the linear dimensions of the animal; which means that, caeteris paribus, the small animal is stronger (having more power per unit weight) than a large one.

> the larger fish ought to be able to put on a spurt of speed far in excess of the smaller one; but the distance travelled by the year's end should be very much alike for both of them. And it should also follow that the curve of fatigue is a steeper one, and the staying power less, in the smaller than in the larger individual.



> The heat lost must, they said, be ‘proportional’ to the surface of the animal.



> smaller animal does produce more heat (per unit of mass) than the large one, in order to keep pace with surface-loss; and that this extra heat-production means more energy spent, more food consumed, more work done.

> If an elephant were as strong in proportion as a stagbeetle, it would be able to pull up rocks and level mountains.



> we have to do rather with a sudden impulse than with a continued strain



> this impulse should be measured “in terms of” the velocity “imparted.”

> For instance, by being careful to rise upon our instep we increase the length or amplitude of our stride, and improve our speed very materially; and it is curious to see how Nature lengthens this metatarsal joint, or instep-lever, in horse¹ and hare and greyhound, in ostrich and in kangaroo, and in every speedy animal

> In running, walking or swimming, we consider the speed which an animal can attain, and the increase of speed which increasing size permits of. But in flight there is a certain necessary speeda speed (relative to the air) which the bird must attain in order to maintain itself aloft, and which must increase as its size increases.



> For the fact is that the heavy birds must fly quickly, or not at all.



> stationary flight, a very slight and “scarcely” perceptible velocity relatively to the air being sufficient for their support and stability



> as Gray has suggested, the undulating rhythmic movements of the body in motion might somehow damp out the turbulence and perform the remarkable service of keeping complete laminar flow, that is, perfect streamlining.

> Froude's law is an over simplification that fails, among other things, to take into account the intrinsic speed of muscle. This is no doubt related to the fact that in large organisms the rate of metabolism per unit weight of tissue decreases, which makes the analogy of boilers to any energy-transmitting structures in animals somewhat doubtful and further lessens the usefulness of Froude's Law.

> . Their body lies within a hollow shell, the stresses within which increase much faster than the mere scale of size; every hollow structure, every dome or cylinder, grows weaker as it grows larger, and a tin canister is easy to make but a great boiler is a complicated affair. The boiler has to be strengthened by 'stiffening rings' or ridges, and so has the lobster's shell; but there is a limit even to this method of counteracting the weakening effect of size. (Page 33)



> From all the “foregoing” discussion



> Gravity not only controls the actions but also influences the forms of all save the least of organisms



> In their peculiar respiratory system blood does not carry oxygen to the tissues, but innumerable fine tubules or tracheae lead air into the interstices of the body. If we imagine them growing even to the size of crab or lobster, a vast complication of tracheal tubules would be necessary, within which friction would increase and diffusion be retarded, and which would soon be an inefficient and inappropriate mechanism.

> The vibration of vocal chords and auditory drums has this in common with the pendulum-like motion of a limb: that its rate also tends to vary inversely as the square root of the linear dimensions (Page 34)
