> This is especially true for the most innovative ones because they dive into unexplored spaces.



> without critical feedback, you would hardly understand why your original idea did not work.



> You would perceive the new proposal as an unrelated diversion or, most likely, a different conflicting perspective.



> The rule of “Yes, but, and.” We suggest combining the best features of criticism with the best of ideation.



> yielding Idea B



> When you propose Idea A, a colleague first addresses what he perceives to be a flaw in it, provides constructive feedback (this is the “but”), and then suggests a possible way to overcome or avoid the flaw, yielding Idea B (this is the “and”).

> half-backed idea



> To create breakthroughs



> dissent



> do not inhibit ideas



> Progress requires clashing and fusing — not compromising or postponing — different perspectives.



> listening and acknowledgment of the talent and abilities of colleagues



> fosters constructive and positive criticism



> When the “but” becomes an attack on the other idea (or even worse, on the other person), then the result is detrimental. Adding “and” to the “but” fosters constructive and positive criticism, turning it from an idea-killing phrase into a way of expanding the flow of creativity rather than stopping it.



> tap into your creative mind



> alternative interpretations



> When you do not understand the idea, don’t simply say, “That’s unclear to me.” Instead, first point to the specific spot that is unclear and then propose possible alternative interpretations: “Do you mean X or Y?” This helps all participants to see more detailed options.


> When conducted with curiosity and respect, criticism becomes the most advanced form of creativity.
