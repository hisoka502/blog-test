## Highlights
> Perceptual



> usability testing only catches type 1 perceptual problems. Because in those tests you take people out of the real world and assign them tasks. Usability testing doesn't catch domain-specific problems because they only come up in real life use.

> Those about understanding what matters to make the design work so that it does the job for the specific purpose in the specific situation. To do that, you have to understand the world around the design and the progress people are trying to make when they use it.



> If you try to do that with testing, it's already too late. You need to get an understanding of the problem you're solving at the earliest stages, before you've built something to test. It's about forming a better hypothesis.



> If you deeply understand the space the solution needs to fit into, you can iterate without third-party testers.

> The designer should internalize perceptual usability as part of their skill set



> The big domain-specific issues should be caught and prevented early with research and by testing cheap prototypes in the shaping and pre-shaping phases, before placing a bet and building the whole thing.
